# Rhience Asuncion — Virtual Assistant Portfolio (GitHub Pages Ready)

This is a one-page, mobile-friendly portfolio website designed for Rhience Asuncion.
Theme: Sleek Black & Gold (with 2 alternate themes).

## What you'll find in this package
- `index.html` — Main portfolio page (SEO-optimized meta tags included).
- `style.css` — Styling (black & gold theme + responsive layout).
- `script.js` — Simple smooth scroll, reveal animations, theme toggle, contact demo.
- `assets/` — `profile.jpg` (your photo), `resume.pdf` (your resume), `favicon.svg`.
- `README.md` — This file.

## How to use (Publish on GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new GitHub repository named `rhience.github.io` (or any other name). If you want the clean URL `https://rhience.github.io` name the repo exactly `rhience.github.io`.
2. Upload all files and folders from this package to the repository root.
3. In the repository settings → Pages, choose the `main` (or `master`) branch and the `/ (root)` folder, then Save.
4. Wait a few minutes, then visit `https://rhience.github.io` (or `https://{your-username}.github.io/{repo-name}` if using a different repo name).

## Editing content
- Replace / edit text in `index.html` to update sections.
- Replace `assets/profile.jpg` with a different photo of the same name/size.
- Replace `assets/resume.pdf` with an updated resume PDF of the same name.
- Tool logos and additional images can be placed in `assets/` and referenced in the HTML.

## Notes
- The contact form is a demo placeholder. For real submissions, integrate with an email service (Formspree, Netlify Forms, or a backend).
- The LinkedIn embed is a lightweight iframe placeholder — LinkedIn may require authentication or a proper embed code for a live preview.
